# Missing Data in Pandas
This folder contains code accompanying the tutorial: [How to Deal with Missing Data in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deal-with-missing-data-in-python-1f74a9112d93).

We discuss various ways of handling/imputing missing values using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). You can find many examples in the Jupyter notebook in this folder.
